Certainly, here are the instructions with some rephrasing:

1. Configure the Advantech Inal2 with the IP address 10.24.12.100.
    - Use the following credentials:
    ```
    username: embedded
    password: pitagora
    ```
2. To establish an SSH connection to the Advantech Inal2, use the following commands:

    - SSH without X forwarding:
    ```ssh
    ssh embedded@10.24.12.100
    ```

    - SSH with X forwarding:
    ```ssh
    ssh embedded@10.24.12.100 -X
    ```

3. To set up the system, follow these steps:

    - Terminal 1: Start the EtherCAT master:
    ```
    ecat_master
    ```
    - Terminal 2: Begin ROS:
    ```
    roscore
    ```
    - Terminal 2: Launch the Xbotcore in position control mode:

    ```
    xbot2-core --hw ec_pos
    ```

    - For impedance control, use:
    ```
    xbot2-core --hw ec_imp
    ```
    - To simulate a dummy robot in RViz:
    ```
    xbot2-core --hw dummy
    ```

If the robot computer is connected to the IIT network and requires internet access, obtain an IP address from the DHCP server:
```
sudo dhclient eno1:0
```
